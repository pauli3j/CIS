Overview
Introduction

The CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls") started as a simple grassroots
activity to identify the most common and important real-world cyber-attacks that affect
enterprises every day, translate that knowledge and experience into positive, constructive
action for defenders, and then share that information with a wider audience. The original
goals were modest-to help people and enterprises focus their attention and get started
on the most important steps to defend themselves from the attacks that really mattered.

Led by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the CIS Controls have matured into an
international community of volunteer individuals and institutions that:

Share insights into attacks and attackers, identify root causes, and translate that
into classes of defensive action

Create and share tools, working aids, and stories of adoption and problem-solving
Map the CIS Controls to regulatory and compliance frameworks in order to ensure
alignment and bring collective priority and focus to them

Identify common problems and barriers (like initial assessment and implementation
roadmaps), and solve them as a community

The CIS Controls reflect the combined knowledge of experts from every part of the
ecosystem (companies, governments, individuals), with every role (threat responders
and analysts, technologists, information technology (IT) operators and defenders,
vulnerability-finders, tool makers, solution providers, users, policy-makers, auditors,
etc.), and across many sectors (government, power, defense, finance, transportation,
academia, consulting, security, IT, etc.), who have banded together to create, adopt, and
support the CIS Controls.

Evolution of the CIS Controls

CIS Controls v8

The CIS Controls started like many similar activities; we gathered experts together,
and shared and argued until we reached an agreement. This can be very valuable,
depending on the people at the table and their experience. Through documenting and
sharing the output, all enterprises can benefit from the work of people they cannot
hire or even meet. You can improve the outcome (and your confidence in it) through
selecting experts that represent a wide range of knowledge, bringing consistency to the
process, and ensuring use of the best-available information (especially about attacks).
In the end, you are still depending on the good judgment of a relatively small group of
people, captured in an informal and narrative way.

At CIS, we have been on a multi-year path to bring more data, rigor, and transparency
to the process of best practice recommendations (the CIS Benchmarksâ¢ and the
CIS Controls). All of these elements are essential to the maturation of a science to
underlie cyber defense; and, all are necessary to allow the tailoring and "negotiation" of
security actions applicable in specific cases, and as required through specific security
frameworks, regulations, and similar oversight schemes.

In the earliest versions of the CIS Controls, we used a standard list of publicly known
attacks as a simple and informal test of the usefulness of specific recommendations.
Starting in 2013, we worked with the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)
team to map the results of their large-scale data analysis directly to the CIS Controls,
as a way to match their summaries of attacks into a standard program for defensive
improvement.
CIS has recently released the Community Defense Model (CDM), which is our most
data-driven approach so far. In its initial version, the CDM looks at the conclusions from
the most recent Verizon DBIR, along with data from the Multi-State Information Sharing
and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), to identify what we believe to be the five most
important types of attacks. We describe those attacks using the MITRE Adversarial
Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (MITRE ATT&CK") Framework in
order to create attack patterns (or specific combinations of Tactics and Techniques used
in those attacks). This allows us to analyze the value of individual defensive actions
(i.e., Safeguards) against those attacks. Specifically, it also provides a consistent and
explainable way to look at the security value of a given set of defensive actions across
the attacker's life cycle, and provide a basis for strategies like defense-in-depth. The
details of this analysis are available on the CIS website. The bottom line is that we have
taken a major step towards identifying the security value of the CIS Controls, or any
subset of them. While these ideas are still evolving, at CIS we are committed to the idea
of security recommendations based on data, presented transparently. For additional
information, reference https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8/.

These activities ensure that the CIS Security Best Practices (which include the CIS
Controls and CIS Benchmarks) are more than a checklist of "good things to do," or
"things that could help"; instead, they are a prescriptive, prioritized, highly focused set of
actions that have a community support network to make them implementable, usable,
scalable, and in alignment with all industry or government security requirements.

This Version of the CIS Controls

When we begin the work of a new version, we first sit down to establish "design
principles" that will be used to guide the process. These serve as a decision
"touchstone" to remind us of what is really important, and of the goals of the CIS
Controls. While these have been fairly consistent since the earliest versions of the CIS
Controls, we have been refining our thinking over the last couple of versions to focus on
the role that the CIS Controls play in the total picture of enterprise security.
Our design principles include:

Offense Informs Defense

CIS Controls are selected, dropped, and prioritized based on data, and on
specific knowledge of attacker behavior and how to stop it

Focus

Help defenders identify the most critical things they need to do to stop the most
important attacks

Avoid being tempted to solve every security problem-avoid adding "good
things to do" or "things you could do"

Feasible

All individual recommendations (Safeguards) must be specific and practical to
implement

Measurable

All CIS Controls, especially for Implementation Group 1, must be measurable
Simplify or remove ambiguous language to avoid inconsistent interpretation
Some Safeguards may have a threshold

"Safeguards" were known as "Sub-Controls" prior to Version 8 of the CIS Controls.

Align

Create and demonstrate "peaceful co-existence" with other governance,
regulatory, process management schemes, framework, and structures
Cooperate with and point to existing, independent standards and security
recommendations where they exist, e.g., National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), Software Assurance Forum
for Excellence in Code (SAFECode), ATT&CK, Open Web Application Security
Project (OWASP )

In addition, since Version 7, we have all seen significant changes in technology and the
cybersecurity ecosystem. Movement to cloud-based computing, virtualization, mobility,
outsourcing, Work-from-Home, and changing attacker tactics have been central in
every discussion. Physical devices, fixed boundaries, and discrete islands of security
implementation are less important, and so we reflect that in Version 8, through revised
terminology and grouping of Safeguards. Also, to guide adopters in implementing
Version 8, CIS created a glossary to remove ambiguity of terminology. Some ideas
have been combined or grouped differently to more naturally reflect the evolution of
technology, rather than how enterprise teams or responsibilities might be organized,
and always referring back to our guiding principles.

The text of the CIS Controls document is just one step of a process to design,
implement, measure, report, and manage enterprise security. Taking this entire work
stream into account as we write the CIS Controls, we can support the total enterprise
management process through: making sure that each Safeguard asks for "one thing,"
wherever possible, in a way that is clear and requires minimal interpretation; that we
focus on measurable actions, and define the measurement as part of the process; and,
that we simplify the language to avoid duplication.

At CIS, we have always tried to be very conscious of the balance between addressing
current topics and the stability of an overall defensive improvement program. We have
always tried to focus on the foundations of good cyber defense-and, always tried to
keep our eyes on emerging new defensive technology-while avoiding the "shiny new
toys" or complex technology that is out of reach for most enterprises.

The CIS Controls Ecosystem ("It's not about the list")

Whether you use the CIS Controls, and/or another way to guide your security
improvement program, you should recognize that "it's not about the list." You can get a
credible list of security recommendations from many sources-it is best to think of the
list as a starting point. It is important to look for the ecosystem that grows up around
the list. Where can I get training, complementary information, explanations; how have
others implemented and used these recommendations; is there a marketplace of
vendor tools and services to choose from; how will I measure progress or maturity;
how does this align with the myriad regulatory and compliance frameworks that
apply to me? The true power of the CIS Controls is not about creating the best list, it
is about harnessing the experience of a community of individuals and enterprises to
actually make security improvements through the sharing of ideas, tools, lessons, and
collective action.

To support this, CIS acts as a catalyst and clearinghouse to help us all learn from each
other. Since Version 6, there has been an explosion of complementary information,
products, and services available from CIS, and from the industry-at-large. Please
contact CIS for the following kinds of working aids and other support materials,

ESSENTIAL CYBER HYGIENE
IG1

IG2 IG3

Historically, the CIS Controls were ordered in sequence to focus an enterprise's
cybersecurity activities, with a subset of the first six CIS Controls referred to as
"cyber hygiene." However, this proved to be too simplistic. Enterprises, especially
small ones, could struggle with some of the early Safeguards and never get around
to implementing later CIS Controls (for example, having a backup strategy to help
recover from ransomware). As a result, starting with Version 7.1, we created CIS
Controls Implementation Groups (IGs) as our recommended new guidance to prioritize
implementation.

The CIS Controls IGs are self-assessed categories for enterprises. Each IG identifies a
subset of the CIS Controls that the community has broadly assessed to be applicable
for an enterprise with a similar risk profile and resources to strive to implement. These
IGs represent a horizontal look across the CIS Controls tailored to different types
of enterprises. Specifically, we have defined IG1 as "essential cyber hygiene," the
foundational set of cyber defense Safeguards that every enterprise should apply to
guard against the most common attacks (https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8/).
Each IG then builds upon the previous one: IG2 includes IG1, and IG3 includes all CIS
Safeguards in IG1 and IG2.

Using or Transitioning from Prior Versions of the CIS Controls

We believe that Version 8 of the CIS Controls is the best we have ever produced.
We also appreciate that enterprises who are actively using prior versions of the CIS
Controls as a key part of their defensive strategy might be reluctant to move to Version
8. Our recommendation is that if you are using Version 7 or Version 7.1, you are following
an effective and usable security plan, and over time you should consider moving to
Version 8. If you are using Version 6 (or earlier), our recommendation is that you should
start to plan a transition to Version 8 as soon as practicable.

For prior versions of the CIS Controls, we were able to provide only the simplest tools
to aid in transition from prior versions, basically a spreadsheet-based change log. For
Version 8, we have taken a much more holistic approach and worked with numerous
partners to ensure that the CIS Controls ecosystem is ready to support your transition,
https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8/.

to dedicate towards protecting IT assets and personnel. The principal concern of
these enterprises is to keep the business operational, as they have a limited tolerance
for downtime. The sensitivity of the data that they are trying to protect is low and
principally surrounds employee and financial information.

Safeguards selected for IG1 should be implementable with limited cybersecurity
expertise and aimed to thwart general, non-targeted attacks. These Safeguards will also
typically be designed to work in conjunction with small or home office commercial off-
the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software.

IG2 (Includes IG1)

An IG2 enterprise employs individuals responsible for managing and protecting IT
infrastructure. These enterprises support multiple departments with differing risk
profiles based on job function and mission. Small enterprise units may have regulatory
compliance burdens. IG2 enterprises often store and process sensitive client or
enterprise information and can withstand short interruptions of service. A major
concern is loss of public confidence if a breach occurs.

Safeguards selected for IG2 help security teams cope with increased operational
complexity. Some Safeguards will depend on enterprise-grade technology and
specialized expertise to properly install and configure.

IG3 (Includes IG1 and IG2)

An IG3 enterprise employs security experts that specialize in the different facets of
cybersecurity (e.g., risk management, penetration testing, application security). IG3
assets and data contain sensitive information or functions that are subject to regulatory
and compliance oversight. An IG3 enterprise must address availability of services
and the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. Successful attacks can cause
significant harm to the public welfare.

Safeguards selected for IG3 must abate targeted attacks from a sophisticated adversary
and reduce the impact of zero-day attacks.

OVERVIEW

Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all enterprise assets (end-user
devices, including portable and mobile; network devices; non-computing/Internet
of Things (IoT) devices; and servers) connected to the infrastructure physically,
virtually, remotely, and those within cloud environments, to accurately know the
totality of assets that need to be monitored and protected within the enterprise.
This will also support identifying unauthorized and unmanaged assets to remove
or remediate.

Why is this Control critical?

Enterprises cannot defend what they do not know they have. Managed control of all
enterprise assets also plays a critical role in security monitoring, incident response,
system backup, and recovery. Enterprises should know what data is critical to them,
and proper asset management will help identify those enterprise assets that hold or
manage this critical data, so that appropriate security controls can be applied.

External attackers are continuously scanning the internet address space of target
enterprises, premise-based or in the cloud, identifying possibly unprotected assets
attached to an enterprise's network. Attackers can take advantage of new assets that
are installed, yet not securely configured and patched. Internally, unidentified assets
can also have weaksecurity configurations that can make them vulnerable to web- or
email-based malware; and, adversaries can leverage weak security configurations for
traversing the network, once they are inside.

Additional assets that connect to the enterprise's network (e.g., demonstration systems,
temporary test systems, guest networks) should be identified and/or isolated in order to
prevent adversarial access from affecting the security of enterprise operations.

Large, complex, dynamic enterprises understandably struggle with the challenge of
managing intricate, fast-changing environments. However, attackers have shown the
ability, patience, and willingness to "inventory and control" our enterprise assets at very
large scale in order to support their opportunities.

Another challenge is that portable end-user devices will periodically join a network
and then disappear, making the inventory of currently available assets very dynamic.
Likewise, cloud environments and virtual machines can be difficult to track in asset
inventories when they are shut down or paused.

Another benefit of complete enterprise asset management is supporting incident
response, both when investigating the origination of network traffic from an asset on
the network and when identifying all potentially vulnerable, or impacted, assets of
similar type or location during an incident.
Procedures and tools

This CIS Control requires both technical and procedural actions, united in a process
that accounts for, and manages the inventory of, enterprise assets and all associated
data throughout its life cycle. It also links to business governance through establishing
data/asset owners who are responsible for each component of a business process.
Enterprises can use large-scale, comprehensive enterprise products to maintain IT
asset inventories. Smaller enterprises can leverage security tools already installed on
enterprise assets or used on the network to collect this data. This includes doing a
discovery scan of the network with a vulnerability scanner; reviewing anti-malware
logs, logs from endpoint security portals, network logs from switches, or authentication
logs; and managing the results in a spreadsheet or database.

Maintaining a current and accurate view of enterprise assets is an ongoing and
dynamic process. Even for enterprises, there is rarely a single source of truth, as
enterprise assets are not always provisioned or installed by the IT department. The
reality is that a variety of sources need to be "crowd-sourced" to determine a high-
confidence count of enterprise assets. Enterprises can actively scan on a regular
basis, sending a variety of different packet types to identify assets connected to the
network. In addition to asset sources mentioned above for small enterprises, larger
enterprises can collect data from cloud portals and logs from enterprise platforms such
as: Active Directory (AD), Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),
Virtual Private Network (VPN), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Deep Packet
Inspection (DPI), Mobile Device Management (MDM), and vulnerability scanning
tools. Property inventory databases, purchase order tracking, and local inventory
lists are other sources of data to determine which devices are connected. There are
tools and methods that normalize this data to identify devices that are unique among
these sources.

Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software (operating systems and
applications) on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can
execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented
from installation or execution.

Why is this Control critical?

A complete software inventory is a critical foundation for preventing attacks. Attackers
continuously scan target enterprises looking for vulnerable versions of software
that can be remotely exploited. For example, if a user opens a malicious website or
attachment with a vulnerable browser, an attacker can often install backdoor programs
and bots that give the attacker long-term control of the system. Attackers can also
use this access to move laterally through the network. One of the key defenses
against these attacks is updating and patching software. However, without a complete
inventory of software assets, an enterprise cannot determine if they have vulnerable
software, or if there are potential licensing violations.

Even if a patch is not yet available, a complete software inventory list allows
an enterprise to guard against known attacks until the patch is released. Some
sophisticated attackers use "zero-day exploits," which take advantage of previously
unknown vulnerabilities that have yet to have a patch released from the software
vendor. Depending on the severity of the exploit, an enterprise can implement
temporary mitigation measures to guard against attacks until the patch is released.

Management of software assets is also important to identify unnecessary security risks.
An enterprise should review its software inventory to identify any enterprise assets
running software that is not needed for business purposes. For example, an enterprise
asset may come installed with default software that creates a potential security risk and
provides no benefit to the enterprise. It is critical to inventory, understand, assess, and
manage all software connected to an enterprise's infrastructure.
Procedures and tools

CIS Controls v8

Allowlisting can be implemented using a combination of commercial allowlisting
tools, policies, or application execution tools that come with anti-malware suites and
popular operating systems. Commercial software inventory tools are widely available
and used in many enterprises today. The best of these tools provides an inventory
check of hundreds of common software used in enterprises. The tools pull information
about the patch level of each installed program to ensure that it is the latest version
and leverage standardized application names, such as those found in the Common
Platform Enumeration (CPE) specification. One example of a method that can be used
is the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). Additional information on SCAP
can be found here: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Special Publications/NIST.
SP.800-126r3.pdf

Features that implement allowlists are included in many modern endpoint security
suites and even natively implemented in certain versions of major operating systems.
Moreover, commercial solutions are increasingly bundling together anti-malware, anti-
spyware, personal firewall, and host-based IDS and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS),
along with application allow and block listing. In particular, most endpoint security
solutions can look at the name, file system location, and/or cryptographic hash of a
given executable to determine whether the application should be allowed to run on
the protected machine. The most effective of these tools offer custom allowlists based
on executable path, hash, or regular expression matching. Some even include a non-
malicious, yet unapproved, applications function that allows administrators to define
rules for execution of specific software for certain users and at certain times of the day.

Develop processes and technical controls to identify, classify, securely handle,
retain, and dispose of data.

Why is this Control critical?

Data is no longer only contained within an enterprise's border; it is in the cloud, on
portable end-user devices where users work from home, and is often shared with
partners or online services that might have it anywhere in the world. In addition
to sensitive data an enterprise holds related to finances, intellectual property, and
customer data, there also might be numerous international regulations for protection
of personal data. Data privacy has become increasingly important, and enterprises are
learning that privacy is about the appropriate use and management of data, not just
encryption. Data must be appropriately managed through its entire life cycle. These
privacy rules can be complicated for multi-national enterprises of any size; however,
there are fundamentals that can apply to all.

Once attackers have penetrated an enterprise's infrastructure, one of their first tasks is
to find and exfiltrate data. Enterprises might not be aware that sensitive data is leaving
their environment because they are not monitoring data outflows.

While many attacks occur on the network, others involve physical theft of portable
end-user devices, attacks on service providers or other partners holding sensitive data.
Other sensitive enterprise assets may also include non-computing devices that provide
management and control of physical systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems.

The enterprise's loss of control over protected or sensitive data is a serious and often
reportable business impact. While some data is compromised or lost as a result of theft
or espionage, the vast majority are a result of poorly understood data management
rules, and user error. The adoption of data encryption, both in transit and at rest,
can provide mitigation against data compromise, and, even more important, it is a
regulatory requirement for most controlled data.
Procedures and tools

It is important for an enterprise to develop a data management process that includes
a data management framework, data classification guidelines, and requirements
for protection, handling, retention, and disposal of data. There should also be a data
breach process that plugs into the incident response plan, and the compliance and
communication plans. To derive data sensitivity levels, enterprises need to catalog
their key types of data and the overall criticality (impact to its loss or corruption) to the
enterprise. This analysis would be used to create an overall data classification scheme
for the enterprise. Enterprises may use labels, such as "Sensitive," "Confidential," and
"Public," and classify their data according to those labels.

Once the sensitivity of the data has been defined, a data inventory or mapping
should be developed that identifies software accessing data at various sensitivity
levels and the enterprise assets that house those applications. Ideally, the network
would be separated so that enterprise assets of the same sensitivity level are on the
same network and separated from enterprise assets with different sensitivity levels. If
possible, firewalls need to control access to each segment, and have user access rules
applied to only allow those with a business need to access the data.

SAFEGUARDS TOTAL 12

IG1 7/12 IG2 $11/12$ IG3 12/12

Establish and maintain the secure configuration of enterprise assets (end-user
devices, including portable and mobile; network devices; non-computing/loT
devices; and servers) and software (operating systems and applications).

Why is this Control critical?

As delivered from manufacturers and resellers, the default configurations for enterprise
assets and software are normally geared towards ease-of-deployment and ease-of-
use rather than security. Basic controls, open services and ports, default accounts or
passwords, pre-configured Domain Name System (DNS) settings, older (vulnerable)
protocols, and pre-installation of unnecessary software can all be exploitable if left in
their default state. Further, these security configuration updates need to be managed
and maintained over the life cycle of enterprise assets and software. Configuration
updates need to be tracked and approved through configuration management workflow
process to maintain a record that can be reviewed for compliance, leveraged for
incident response, and to support audits. This CIS Control is important to on-premises
devices, as well as remote devices, network devices, and cloud environments.

Service providers play a key role in modern infrastructures, especially for smaller
enterprises. They often are not set up by default in the most secure configuration to
provide flexibility for their customers to apply their own security policies. Therefore,
the presence of default accounts or passwords, excessive access, or unnecessary
services are common in default configurations. These could introduce weaknesses that
are under the responsibility of the enterprise that is using the software, rather than the
service provider. This extends to ongoing management and updates, as some Platform
as a Service (PaaS) only extend to the operating system, so patching and updating
hosted applications are under the responsibility of the enterprise.

Even after a strong initial configuration is developed and applied, it must be continually
managed to avoid degrading security as software is updated or patched, new security
vulnerabilities are reported, and configurations are "tweaked," to allow the installation of
new software or to support new operational requirements.
Procedures and tools

There are many available security baselines for each system. Enterprises should start
with these publicly developed, vetted, and supported security benchmarks, security
guides, or checklists. Some resources include:

â The CIS Benchmarksâ¢ Program-http://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/

â The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Checklist
Program Repository-https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository

Enterprises should augment or adjust these baselines to satisfy enterprise security
policies, and industry and government regulatory requirements. Deviations of standard
configurations and rationale should be documented to facilitate future reviews or audits.

For a larger or more complex enterprise, there will be multiple security baseline
configurations based on security requirements or classification of the data on the
enterprise asset. Here is an example of the steps to build a secure baseline image:

01 Determine the risk classification of the data handled/stored on the enterprise asset
(e.g., high, moderate, low risk).

02 Create a security configuration script that sets system security settings to meet the
requirements to protect the data used on the enterprise asset. Use benchmarks,
such as the ones described earlier in this section.

03 Install the base operating system software.

04 Apply appropriate operating system and security patches.

05 Install appropriate application software packages, tool, and utilities.

06 Apply appropriate updates to software installed in Step 4.

07 Install local customization scripts to this image.

08 Run the security script created in Step 2 to set the appropriate security level.

09 Run a SCAP compliant tool to record/score the system setting of the baseline
image.

10 Perform a security quality assurance test.

11 Save this base image in a secure location.

Commercial and/or free configuration management tools, such as the CIS Configuration
Assessment Tool (CIS-CAT) https://learn.cisecurity.org/cis-cat-lite, can be
deployed to measure the settings of operating systems and applications of managed
machines to look for deviations from the standard image configurations. Commercial
configuration management tools use some combination of an agent installed on each
managed system, or agentless inspection of systems through remotely logging into
each enterprise asset using administrator credentials. Additionally, a hybrid approach is
sometimes used whereby a remote session is initiated, a temporary or dynamic agent is
deployed on the target system for the scan, and then the agent is removed.

Use processes and tools to assign and manage authorization to credentials for
user accounts, including administrator accounts, as well as service accounts, to
enterprise assets and software.

Why is this Control critical?

It is easier for an external or internal threat actor to gain unauthorized access to
enterprise assets or data through using valid user credentials than through "hacking"
the environment. There are many ways to covertly obtain access to user accounts,
including: weak passwords, accounts still valid after a user leaves the enterprise,
dormant or lingering test accounts, shared accounts that have not been changed in
months or years, service accounts embedded in applications for scripts, a user having
the same password as one they use for an online account that has been compromised
(in a public password dump), social engineering a user to give their password, or using
malware to capture passwords or tokens in memory or over the network.

Administrative, or highly privileged, accounts are a particular target, because they allow
attackers to add other accounts, or make changes to assets that could make them
more vulnerable to other attacks. Service accounts are also sensitive, as they are often
shared among teams, internal and external to the enterprise, and sometimes not known
about, only to be revealed in standard account management audits.

Finally, account logging and monitoring is a critical component of security operations.
While account logging and monitoring are covered in CIS Control 8 (Audit Log
Management), it is important in the development of a comprehensive Identity and
Access Management (IAM) program.

Procedures and tools

Credentials are assets that must be inventoried and tracked like enterprise assets and
software, as they are the primary entry point into the enterprise. Appropriate password
policies and guidance not to reuse passwords should be developed.

â For guidance on the creation and use of passwords, reference the CIS
Password Policy Guide -https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-
password-policy-guide/

Accounts must also be tracked; any account that is dormant must be disabled and
eventually removed from the system. There should be periodic audits to ensure all
active accounts are traced back to authorized users of the enterprise asset. Look
for new accounts added since previous review, especially administrator and service
accounts. Close attention should be made to identify and track administrative, or high-
privileged accounts and service accounts.
Safeguards

Users with administrator or other privileged access should have separate accounts for
those higher authority tasks. These accounts would only be used when performing
those tasks or accessing especially sensitive data, to reduce risk in case their normal
user account is compromised. For users with multiple accounts, their base user
account, used day-to-day for non-administrative tasks, should not have any elevated
privileges.

Single Sign-On (SSO) is convenient and secure when an enterprise has many
applications, including cloud applications, which helps reduce the number of
passwords a user must manage. Users are recommended to use password manager
applications to securely store their passwords, and should be instructed not to keep
them in spreadsheets or text files on their computers. MFA is recommended for
remote access.

Users must also be automatically logged out of the system after a period of inactivity,
and be trained to lock their screen when they leave their device to minimize the
possibility of someone else in physical proximity around the user accessing their
system, applications, or data.

OVERVIEW

Use processes and tools to create, assign, manage, and revoke access credentials
and privileges for user, administrator, and service accounts for enterprise assets
and software.

Why is this Control critical?

Where CIS Control 5 deals specifically with account management, CIS Control 6
focuses on managing what access these accounts have, ensuring users only have
access to the data or enterprise assets appropriate for their role, and ensuring that
there is strong authentication for critical or sensitive enterprise data or functions.
Accounts should only have the minimal authorization needed for the role. Developing
consistent access rights for each role and assigning roles to users is a best practice.
Developing a program for complete provision and de-provisioning access is also
important. Centralizing this function is ideal.

There are some user activities that pose greater risk to an enterprise, either because
they are accessed from untrusted networks, or performing administrator functions
that allow the ability to add, change, or remove other accounts, or make configuration
changes to operating systems or applications to make them less secure. This also
enforces the importance of using MFA and Privileged Access Management (PAM) tools.

Some users have access to enterprise assets or data they do not need for their role; this
might be due to an immature process that gives all users all access, or lingering access
as users change roles within the enterprise over time. Local administrator privileges to
users' laptops is also an issue, as any malicious code installed or downloaded by the
user can have greater impact on the enterprise asset running as administrator. User,
administrator, and service account access should be based on enterprise role and need.

Procedures and tools

There should be a process where privileges are granted and revoked for user accounts.
This ideally is based on enterprise role and need through role-based access. Role-
based access is a technique to define and manage access requirements for each
account based on: need to know, least privilege, privacy requirements, and/or
separation of duties. There are technology tools to help manage this process. However,
there might be more granular or temporary access based on circumstance.

MFA should be universal for all privileged or administrator accounts. There are many
tools that have smartphone applications to perform this function, and are easy to
deploy. Using the number-generator feature is more secure than just sending a
Short Messaging Service (SMS) message with a one-time code, or prompting a
"push" alert for a user to accept. However, neither is recommended for privileged
account MFA. PAM tools are available for privileged account control, and provide a
one-time password that must be checked out for each use. For additional security
in system administration, using "jump-boxes" or out of band terminal connections is
recommended.

Comprehensive account de-provisioning is important. Many enterprises have
repeatable consistent processes for removing access when employees leave the
enterprise. However, that process is not always consistent for contractors, and must be
included in the standard de-provisioning process. Enterprises should also inventory and
track service accounts, as a common error is leaving clear text tokens or passwords in
code, and posting to public cloud-based code repositories.

High-privileged accounts should not be used for day-to-day use, such as web surfing
and email reading. Administrators should have separate accounts that do not have
elevated privileges for daily office use, and should log into administrator accounts only
when performing administrator functions requiring that level of authorization. Security
personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to determine whether
any browsers or email readers are running with high privileges.

OVERVIEW

Develop a plan to continuously assess and track vulnerabilities on all enterprise
assets within the enterprise's infrastructure, in order to remediate, and minimize, the
window of opportunity for attackers. Monitor public and private industry sources for
new threat and vulnerability information.

Why is this Control critical?

Cyber defenders are constantly being challenged from attackers who are looking for
vulnerabilities within their infrastructure to exploit and gain access. Defenders must
have timely threat information available to them about: software updates, patches,
security advisories, threat bulletins, etc., and they should regularly review their
environment to identify these vulnerabilities before the attackers do. Understanding
and managing vulnerabilities is a continuous activity, requiring focus of time, attention,
and resources.

Attackers have access to the same information and can often take advantage of
vulnerabilities more quickly than an enterprise can remediate. While there is a gap in
time from a vulnerability being known to when it is patched, defenders can prioritize
which vulnerabilities are most impactful to the enterprise, or likely to be exploited
first due to ease of use. For example, when researchers or the community report new
vulnerabilities, vendors have to develop and deploy patches, indicators of compromise
(IOCs), and updates. Defenders need to assess the risk of the new vulnerability to the
enterprise, regression-test patches, and install the patch.

There is never perfection in this process. Attackers might be using an exploit to
a vulnerability that is not known within the security community. They might have
developed an exploit to this vulnerability referred to as a "zero-day" exploit. Once
the vulnerability is known in the community, the process mentioned above starts.
Therefore, defenders must keep in mind that an exploit might already exist when the
vulnerability is widely socialized. Sometimes vulnerabilities might be known within
a closed community (e.g., vendor still developing a fix) for weeks, months, or years
before it is disclosed publicly. Defenders have to be aware that there might always
be vulnerabilities they cannot remediate, and therefore need to use other controls
to mitigate.

Enterprises that do not assess their infrastructure for vulnerabilities and proactively
address discovered flaws face a significant likelihood of having their enterprise assets
compromised. Defenders face particular challenges in scaling remediation across an
entire enterprise, and prioritizing actions with conflicting priorities, while not impacting
the enterprise's business or mission.
Procedures and tools

A large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate the security
configuration of enterprise assets. Some enterprises have also found commercial
services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help
standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities across an enterprise, it is
preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that map vulnerabilities to one or more of
the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration and platform classification
schemes and languages: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), Common
Configuration Enumeration (CCE), Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language
(OVAL), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS), and/or Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF). These
schemes and languages are components of SCAP.

â More information on SCAP can be found here - https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/
nistpubs/Special Publications/NIST.SP.800-126r3.pdf

The frequency of scanning activities should increase as the diversity of an enterprise's
assets increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor. Advanced
vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to authenticate
into enterprise assets and perform more comprehensive assessments. These are called
"authenticated scans."

In addition to the scanning tools that check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
across the network, various free and commercial tools can evaluate security settings
and configurations of enterprise assets. Such tools can provide fine-grained insight
into unauthorized changes in configuration or the inadvertent introduction of security
weaknesses from administrators.

Effective enterprises link their vulnerability scanners with problem-ticketing systems
that track and report progress on fixing vulnerabilities. This can help highlight
unmitigated critical vulnerabilities to senior management to ensure they are resolved.
Enterprises can also track how long it took to remediate a vulnerability, after identified,
or a patch has been issued. These can support internal or industry compliance
requirements. Some mature enterprises will go over these reports in IT security steering
committee meetings, which bring leaders from IT and the business together to prioritize
remediation efforts based on business impact.

In selecting which vulnerabilities to fix, or patches to apply, an enterprise should
augment NIST's Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) with data concerning
the likelihood of a threat actor using a vulnerability, or potential impact of an exploit to
the enterprise. Information on the likelihood of exploitation should also be periodically
updated based on the most current threat information. For example, the release of
a new exploit, or new intelligence relating to exploitation of the vulnerability, should
change the priority through which the vulnerability should be considered for patching.
Various commercial systems are available to allow an enterprise to automate and
maintain this process in a scalable manner.

The most effective vulnerability scanning tools compare the results of the current scan
with previous scans to determine how the vulnerabilities in the environment have
changed over time. Security personnel use these features to conduct vulnerability
trending from month to month.

Finally, there should be a quality assurance process to verify configuration updates, or
that patches are implemented correctly and across all relevant enterprise assets.

OVERVIEW

Collect, alert, review, and retain audit logs of events that could help detect,

Why is this Control critical?

Procedures and tools

26

Log collection and analysis is critical for an enterprise's ability to detect malicious
activity quickly. Sometimes audit records are the only evidence of a successful attack.
Attackers know that many enterprises keep audit logs for compliance purposes, but
rarely analyze them. Attackers use this knowledge to hide their location, malicious
software, and activities on victim machines. Due to poor or nonexistent log analysis
processes, attackers sometimes control victim machines for months or years without
anyone in the target enterprise knowing.

There are two types of logs that are generally treated and often configured independently:
system logs and audit logs. System logs typically provide system-level events that show
various system process start/end times, crashes, etc. These are native to systems, and
take less configuration to turn on. Audit logs typically include user-level events-when a
user logged in, accessed a file, etc.-and take more planning and effort to set up.

Logging records are also critical for incident response. After an attack has been
detected, log analysis can help enterprises understand the extent of an attack.
Complete logging records can show, for example, when and how the attack occurred,
what information was accessed, and if data was exfiltrated. Retention of logs is also
critical in case a follow-up investigation is required or if an attack remained undetected
for a long period of time.

Most enterprise assets and software offer logging capabilities. Such logging should be
activated, with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote
access systems (Virtual Private Network (VPN), dial-up, etc.) should all be configured
for verbose logging where beneficial. Retention of logging data is also important in the
event an incident investigation is required.

Furthermore, all enterprise assets should be configured to create access control
logs when a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges.
To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an enterprise should periodically scan
through its logs and compare them with the enterprise asset inventory assembled as
part of CIS Control 1, in order to ensure that each managed asset actively connected to
the network is periodically generating logs.

Email and Web Browser Protections

OVERVIEW

Improve protections and detections of threats from email and web vectors, as
these are opportunities for attackers to manipulate human behavior through
direct engagement.

Why is this Control critical?

Procedures and tools

28

Web browsers and email clients are very common points of entry for attackers
because of their direct interaction with users inside an enterprise. Content can be
crafted to entice or spoof users into disclosing credentials, providing sensitive data, or
providing an open channel to allow attackers to gain access, thus increasing risk to the
enterprise. Since email and web are the main means that users interact with external
and untrusted users and environments, these are prime targets for both malicious code
and social engineering. Additionally, as enterprises move to web-based email, or mobile
email access, users no longer use traditional full-featured email clients, which provide
embedded security controls like connection encryption, strong authentication, and
phishing reporting buttons.

Web Browser

Cybercriminals can exploit web browsers in multiple ways. If they have access to
exploits of vulnerable browsers, they can craft malicious webpages that can exploit
those vulnerabilities when browsed with an insecure, or unpatched, browser.
Alternatively, they can try to target any number of common web browser third-
party plugins that may allow them to hook into the browser or even directly into
the operating system or application. These plugins, much like any other software
within an environment, need to be reviewed for vulnerabilities, kept up-to-date with
latest patches or versions, and controlled. Many come from untrusted sources, and
some are even written to be malicious. Therefore, it is best to prevent users from
intentionally or unintentionally installing malware that might be hiding in some of
these plugins, extensions, and add-ons. Simple configuration updates to the browser
can make it much harder for malware to get installed through reducing the ability of
installing add-ons/plugins/extensions and preventing specific types of content from
automatically executing.

Most popular browsers employ a database of phishing and/or malware sites to
protect against the most common threats. A best practice is to enable these content
filters and turn on the pop-up blockers. Pop-ups are not only annoying; they can
also host embedded malware directly or lure users into clicking links using social
engineering tricks. To help enforce blocking of known malicious domains, also consider
subscribing to DNS filtering services to block attempts to access these websites at the
network level.
Safeguards

Email

Email represents one the most interactive ways humans work with enterprise assets;
training and encouraging the right behavior is just as important as the technical
settings. Email is the most common threat vector against enterprises through tactics
such as phishing and Business Email Compromise (BEC).

Using a spam-filtering tool and malware scanning at the email gateway reduces the
number of malicious emails and attachments that come into the enterprise's network.
Initiating Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
(DMARC) helps reduce spam and phishing activities. Installing an encryption tool
to secure email and communications adds another layer of user and network-based
security. In addition to blocking based on the sender, it is also worthwhile to only allow
certain file types that users need for their jobs. This will require coordination with
different business units to understand what types of files they receive via email to
ensure that there is not an interruption to their processes.

Since phishing email techniques are ever evolving to get past Something Posing
as Mail (SPAM) filter rules, it is important to train users on how to identify phishing,
and to notify IT Security when they see one. There are many platforms that perform
phishing tests against users to help educate them on different examples, and track
their improvement over time. Crowd-sourcing this knowledge into notifying IT Security
teams of phishing helps improve the protections and detections of email-based threats.

Why is this Control critical?

Procedures and tools

Malicious software (sometimes categorized as viruses or Trojans) is an integral and
dangerous aspect of internet threats. They can have many purposes, from capturing
credentials, stealing data, identifying other targets within the network, and encrypting
or destroying data. Malware is ever-evolving and adaptive, as modern variants leverage
machine learning techniques.

Malware enters an enterprise through vulnerabilities within the enterprise on end-user
devices, email attachments, webpages, cloud services, mobile devices, and removable
media. Malware often relies on insecure end-user behavior, such as clicking links,
opening attachments, installing software or profiles, or inserting Universal Serial Bus
(USB) flash drives. Modern malware is designed to avoid, deceive, or disable defenses.

Malware defenses must be able to operate in this dynamic environment through
automation, timely and rapid updating, and integration with other processes like
vulnerability management and incident response. They must be deployed at all possible
entry points and enterprise assets to detect, prevent spread, or control the execution of
malicious software or code.

Effective malware protection includes traditional endpoint malware prevention and
detection suites. To ensure malware IOCs are up-to-date, enterprises can receive
automated updates from the vendor to enrich other vulnerability or threat data. These
tools are best managed centrally to provide consistency across the infrastructure.

Being able to block or identify malware is only part of this CIS Control; there is also a
focus on centrally collecting the logs to support alerting, identification, and incident
response. As malicious actors continue to develop their methodologies, many are
starting to take a "living-off-the-land" (LotL) approach to minimize the likelihood of
being caught. This approach refers to attacker behavior that uses tools or features that
already exist in the target environment. Enabling logging, as per the Safeguards in
CIS Control 8, will make it significantly easier for the enterprise to follow the events to
understand what happened and why it happened.

Establish and maintain data recovery practices sufficient to restore in-scope
enterprise assets to a pre-incident and trusted state.

Why is this Control critical?

In the cybersecurity triad-Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)-the
availability of data is, in some cases, more critical than its confidentiality. Enterprises
need many types of data to make business decisions, and when that data is not
available or is untrusted, then it could impact the enterprise. An easy example is
weather information to a transportation enterprise.

When attackers compromise assets, they make changes to configurations, add
accounts, and often add software or scripts. These changes are not always easy
to identify, as attackers might have corrupted or replaced trusted applications with
malicious versions, or the changes might appear to be standard-looking account
names. Configuration changes can include adding or changing registry entries, opening
ports, turning off security services, deleting logs, or other malicious actions that
make a system insecure. These actions do not have to be malicious; human error can
cause each of these as well. Therefore, it is important to have an ability to have recent
backups or mirrors to recover enterprise assets and data back to a known trusted state.

There has been an exponential rise in ransomware over the last few years. It is not a
new threat, though it has become more commercialized and organized as a reliable
method for attackers to make money. If an attacker encrypts an enterprise's data and
demands ransom for its restoration, having a recent backup to recover to a known,
trusted state can be helpful. However, as ransomware has evolved, it has also become
an extortion technique, where data is exfiltrated before being encrypted, and the
attacker asks for payment to restore the enterprise's data, as well as to keep it from
being sold or publicized. In this case, restoration would only solve the issue of restoring
systems to a trusted state and continuing operations. Leveraging the guidance within
the CIS Controls will help reduce the risk of ransomware through improved cyber
hygiene, as attackers usually use older or basic exploits on insecure systems.
Procedures and tools

Data recovery procedures should be defined in the data management process
described in CIS Control 3, Data Protection. This should include backup procedures
based on data value, sensitivity, or retention requirements. This will assist in developing

backup frequency and type (full vs. incremental).

Once per quarter (or whenever a new backup process or technology is introduced),
a testing team should evaluate a random sampling of backups and attempt to restore
them on a test bed environment. The restored backups should be verified to ensure
that the operating system, application, and data from the backup are all intact
and functional.
Safeguards

In the event of malware infection, restoration procedures should use a version of the
backup that is believed to predate the original infection.

Establish, implement, and actively manage (track, report, correct) network devices,
in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable network services and
access points.

Why is this Control critical?

Secure network infrastructure is an essential defense against attacks. This includes
an appropriate security architecture, addressing vulnerabilities that are, often times,
introduced with default settings, monitoring for changes, and reassessment of current
configurations. Network infrastructure includes devices such as physical and virtualized
gateways, firewalls, wireless access points, routers, and switches.

Procedures and tools

Default configurations for network devices are geared for ease-of-deployment and
ease-of-use-not security. Potential default vulnerabilities include open services and
ports, default accounts and passwords (including service accounts), support for older
vulnerable protocols, and pre-installation of unneeded software. Attackers search for
vulnerable default settings, gaps or inconsistencies in firewall rule sets, routers,
and switches and use those holes to penetrate defenses. They exploit flaws in these devices
to gain access to networks, redirect traffic on a network, and intercept data while in
transmission.

Network security is a constantly changing environment that necessitates regular
re-evaluation of architecture diagrams, configurations, access controls, and allowed
traffic flows. Attackers take advantage of network device configurations becoming
less secure over time as users demand exceptions for specific business needs.
Sometimes the exceptions are deployed, but not removed when they are no longer
applicable to the business's needs. In some cases, the security risk of an exception is
neither properly analyzed nor measured against the associated business need and can
change over time.

Enterprises should ensure network infrastructure is fully documented and architecture
diagrams are kept up-to-date. It is important for key infrastructure components
to have vendor support for patches and feature upgrades. Upgrade End-of-Life
(EOL) components before the date they will be out of support or apply mitigating
controls to isolate them. Enterprises need to monitor their infrastructure versions and
configurations for vulnerabilities that would require them to upgrade the network
devices to the latest secure and stable version that does not impact the infrastructure.
Safeguards

An up-to-date network architecture diagram, including security architecture diagrams,
are an important foundation for infrastructure management. Next is having complete
account management for access control, logging, and monitoring. Finally, infrastructure
administration should only be performed over secure protocols, with strong
authentication (MFA for PAM), and from dedicated administrative devices or out-of-
band networks.

Commercial tools can be helpful to evaluate the rule sets of network filtering devices to
determine whether they are consistent or in conflict. This provides an automated sanity
check of network filters. These tools search for errors in rule sets or Access Controls
Lists (ACLs) that may allow unintended services through the network device. Such
tools should be run each time significant changes are made to firewall rule sets, router
ACLS, or other filtering technologies.

Operate processes and tooling to establish and maintain comprehensive network
monitoring and defense against security threats across the enterprise's network
infrastructure and user base.

Why is this Control critical?

We cannot rely on network defenses to be perfect. Adversaries continue to evolve
and mature, as they share, or sell, information among their community on exploits
and bypasses to security controls. Even if security tools work "as advertised," it takes
an understanding of the enterprise risk posture to configure, tune, and log them to be
effective. Often, misconfigurations due to human error or lack of knowledge of tool
capabilities give enterprises a false sense of security.

Security tools can only be effective if they are supporting a process of continuous
monitoring that allows staff the ability to be alerted and respond to security incidents
quickly. Enterprises that adopt a purely technology-driven approach will also experience
more false positives, due to their over-reliance on alerts from tools. Identifying and
responding to these threats requires visibility into all threat vectors of the infrastructure
and leveraging humans in the process of detection, analysis, and response. It is critical
for large or heavily targeted enterprises to have a security operations capability to
prevent, detect, and quickly respond to cyber threats before they can impact the
enterprise. This process will generate activity reports and metrics that will help enhance
security policies, and support regulatory compliance for many enterprises.

As we have seen many times in the press, enterprises have been compromised for
weeks, months, or years before discovery. The primary benefit of having comprehensive
situational awareness is to increase the speed of detection and response. This is
critical to respond quickly when malware is discovered, credentials are stolen, or when
sensitive data is compromised to reduce impact to the enterprise.

Through good situational awareness (i.e., security operations), enterprises will identify
and catalog Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of attackers, including their
IOCs that will help the enterprise become more proactive in identifying future threats or
incidents. Recovery can be achieved faster when the response has access to complete
information about the environment and enterprise structure to develop efficient
response strategies.
Procedures and tools

Most enterprises do not need to stand up a Security Operations Center (SOC) to
gain situational awareness. This starts with first understanding critical business
functions, network and server architectures, data and data flows, vendor service and
business partner connection, and end-user devices and accounts. This informs the
development of a security architecture, technical controls, logging, monitoring, and
response procedures.

At the core of this process is a trained and organized team that implements processes
for incident detection, analysis, and mitigation. These capabilities could be conducted
internally, or through consultants or a managed service provider. Enterprises should
consider network, enterprise asset, user credential, and data access activities.
Technology will play a crucial role to collect and analyze all of
